                    About Me
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying International Relations and Politics with a minor in Human-Computer Interaction. Combining both my interests in political science and human-computer interaction I am interested in bridging the gap between policy and tech through using human centered design thinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I initially became interested in user experience design through classwork in the ethical disparities that exist in technology for underrepresented minorities. Designing with equity & inclusion in mind encompass a few of my core values, and is often reflected in the work I do.

                    At CMU I served as the Internal Vice President for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, coordinating logistics and events. I also served as Activities Board Events Lead, helping plan & execute several events for the general student body (often attended by 250-300 students)
